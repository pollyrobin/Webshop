            This page resides in the <code>/WEB-INF/faces-views</code> folder as
            <code>viewsdemo.xhtml</code>
            and has been automatically scanned by FacesViews. It can be requested with both its
            original extension (<code>viewsdemo.xhtml</code>) as well as without its extension
            (<code>viewsdemo</code>). When <a href="#{request.contextPath}/viewsdemo.xhtml">requesting with an extension</a>
            a redirect will take place to its extensionless variant.
        </p>
        <p>
            To demo that extensionless URLs can be used in combination with other URL rewriters (like the CDI conversation
            scope), the PostRedirectGet variant starts a conversation. When going back and forth between the demo pages with
            PRG, the created time should stay the same after the first navigation.
